summary: A guide on how to make sure your NPM package supports CommonJS even if you have dependencies that are pure ESM.

## TLDR
You have to use a bundler such as [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) which will compile your project and bundle all of it's dependencies along with it so they do not
need to be imported. This bypasses the ESM/CommonJS incompatibility issue.

If you're impatient, you can [go straight to the code with this example implementation](https://github.com/RPate97/esm-commonjs-support).

## Context 
While preparing to release my new project [Token.js](https://github.com/token-js/token.js) over the weekend, I ran into a quite frustrating problem. 
I wanted my package to support CommonJS in addition to ESM, but I had pure ESM dependencies. The pure ESM crusaders out there might be quite unhappy
about me saying it, but if you're building an NPM package and want it to be widely used you still need to support CommonJS in 2024.

> [Token.js](https://github.com/token-js/token.js) is a simple TypeScript SDK that allows you to integrate 60+ LLMs from 9 different providers (OpenAI,
Anthropic, Cohere, etc). Shameless plug, check it out and let me know what you think if you're into generative ai.

Now there are a number of resources online discussing how to build Javascript projects for ESM, CommonJS, or both. However, I specifically had trouble dealing with
the fact that I had dependencies that were pure ESM. I found this quite difficult to deal with because I'm not familiar with bundlers (I've mostly worked on webapp backends),
and was not able to find a good guide on the topic.

So if anyone else is running into this issue, here's the solution.

## Guide

### Install esbuild
We'll be using [esbuild](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74937600/how-to-support-es-modules-and-commonjs-modules-at-the-same-time) for the bundler. 
```bash
yarn add esbuild --save-dev
```

### Create a build script
We'll need a simple build script to run esbuild and output the results.
```JavaScript
import esbuild from 'esbuild'

const entrypoint = "<your entrypoint here>"
const tsconfig = "<your tsconfig path here>"

const build = async () => {
  await Promise.all([
    // bundle for commonjs
    esbuild.build({
      entryPoints: [entrypoint],
      bundle: true,
      minify: true,
      format: 'cjs',
      outfile: `./dist/index.cjs`,
      platform: 'node',
      treeShaking: true,
      tsconfig,
    }),
  ])
}

build()
```

### Add a build script to your package.json
Run with your preferred runtime.
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite-node ./scripts/build.ts",
}
```

I personally love [vite-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-node). So if you want to follow along exactly, you'll need to install that:
```bash
yarn add vite-node --save-dev
```

### Build your project
```bash
yarn build
```

This will cause build your project with esbuild and you'll see a new file, `dist/index.cjs`, which is the CommonJS build of your package.

### Configure entrypoint

Update your package.json to point to your CommonJS entrypoint.
```json
"main": "dist/index.cjs",
```

Bam! There you go, you've now built your package for CommonJS. This will work even if you have ESM dependencies because the dependencies will be bundled
along with your package.

> The dependencies are included in the output because of the field `bundle: true` when `esbuild` is called.

## TypeScript declarations
Though technically not required, you will very likely also want TypeScript declarations which esbuild unfortunately does not output at this time. So to generate
those, you'll want to use normal `tsc`.

### Update your `tsconfig.json`

Adding these options to your `tsconfig.json` file will cause only the TypeScript declarations to be output. This is exactly what we want since the rest of the package
is being built with `esbuild`. 
```json
"declaration": true,
"declarationDir": "./dist",
"emitDeclarationOnly": true
```

### Update your build script
```json
"scripts": {
  "build:tsc": "yarn tsc -p tsconfig.json",
  "build": "vite-node ./scripts/build.ts && yarn build:tsc",
}
```

## Dual Entrypoints
This guide recommends only outputting a single CommonJS entrypoint for your package. Personally, I think this is the best option for two reasons:
- Minimizes the bundle size
- Avoids [dual package hazard](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#dual-package-hazard)

However, this is not the only option. You could also publish your package with dual entrypoints for CommonJS and ESM. 

### To do so, you would just update your build script to also output an ESM build
```JavaScript
import esbuild from 'esbuild'

const entrypoint = "<your entrypoint here>"
const tsconfig = "<your tsconfig path here>"

const build = async () => {
  await Promise.all([
    // bundle for commonjs
    esbuild.build({
      entryPoints: [entrypoint],
      bundle: true,
      minify: true,
      format: 'cjs',
      outfile: `./dist/index.cjs`,
      platform: 'node',
      treeShaking: true,
      tsconfig,
    }),
    // bundle for ESM
    esbuild.build({
      entryPoints: [entrypoint],
      bundle: true,
      minify: true,
      format: 'esm',
      outfile: `./dist/index.js`,
      platform: 'node',
      treeShaking: true,
      tsconfig,
    }),
  ])
}

build()
```

### Then update your package.json file to include both entrypoints
```json
"main": "dist/index.cjs",
"module": "dist/index.js",
"type": "module",
"exports": {
  ".": {
    "import": "./dist/index.js",
    "require": "./dist/index.cjs",
    "types": "./dist/index.d.ts"
  }
},
```
